PART A - Muhammet (Slides 1-8, ~5 minutes)

[Slide 1 - Cover]
Hello everyone. I'm Muhammet Yagcioglu, and my co-presenter is Hamidreza Khalaj Zahraei.
We are with the Izmir Institute of Technology, Department of Civil Engineering.
Our emails are on the slide if you want to follow up.
Today we introduce hydrokinetic power systems from a civil and water resources perspective.

[Slide 2 - Presentation Overview]
I will start with the big picture and why this technology matters.
Then I will define hydrokinetic energy and show how it differs from traditional hydropower.
I will also highlight key applications and global projects.
After that, Hamid will take over and cover engineering, siting, and delivery.

[Slide 3 - Introduction to Hydrokinetic Energy]
Hydrokinetic energy uses the motion of water itself.
Instead of storing water behind a dam, turbines sit in rivers or tidal channels.
This keeps the infrastructure smaller and faster to build.
It is often called zero-head or in-stream power.
The main idea is to harvest energy while keeping the river more natural.

[Slide 4 - Why Humanity Needs HECS]
Electricity demand keeps rising as populations grow and more sectors electrify.
The chart shows steady global growth over time.
At the same time, we must decarbonize the grid.
Hydrokinetic systems provide low-carbon power close to communities.
This combination of local supply and low impact makes the topic urgent.

[Slide 5 - Water-Energy-Climate Nexus]
Climate change is making water more variable and less predictable.
Droughts reduce flows and extreme events damage infrastructure.
Engineers must balance energy production with ecosystem health and community needs.
Hydrokinetic systems help because they avoid large reservoirs or major diversions.
They can be scaled and adapted over time, supporting water security.

[Slide 6 - Kinetic vs Potential Energy]
Conventional hydropower uses potential energy created by head.
That usually requires dams, reservoirs, and sometimes resettlement.
Hydrokinetic systems use kinetic energy in free-flowing water.
This reduces land take and preserves river connectivity.
In many regions, that difference is key for public acceptance.

[Slide 7 - Applications and Benefits]
These systems fit rivers, tidal straits, and coastal channels with steady flow.
Projects can be modular, so utilities can start small and expand.
Visual impact is low and civil works are lighter.
Tides are predictable, which helps grid planning.
That makes hydrokinetic power a strong complement to other renewables.

[Slide 8 - Major Operational Projects by Country]
This table summarizes key operating projects.
In Scotland, the MeyGen array operates at 6 MW, and the Orbital O2 platform is a 2 MW floating turbine.
In Northern Ireland, SeaGen reached 1.2 MW as an early commercial prototype.
In South Korea, Uldolmok runs a 1 MW tidal current station.
These projects show the technology is working in multiple countries and conditions.

HANDOFF POINT: After Slide 8, I will hand over to Hamid.

PART B - Hamid (Slides 9-15, ~5 minutes)

[Slide 9 - Project Highlights and Lessons]
Thanks, Muhammet. I will continue with lessons from these projects.
MeyGen shows how phased arrays can scale while managing environmental approvals.
Orbital O2 shows how floating systems can reduce installation time and allow maintenance at the surface.
SeaGen demonstrated early commercial operation and provided long-term performance data.
Uldolmok shows how government-backed demonstrations can build national expertise.
The lesson is that durability, maintenance access, and permitting are as important as turbine design.

[Slide 10 - Working Principle]
At a basic level, flow turns the rotor.
The rotation drives a shaft connected to a generator.
The generator converts mechanical motion to electricity, and power electronics condition it for the grid.
Sealing and corrosion control are essential in the water environment.
For civil engineers, the key is aligning equipment needs with site conditions.

[Slide 11 - Site Selection and Resource Assessment]
Good sites have consistent flow and adequate depth.
Bed material and scour risk define the foundation strategy.
Proximity to loads and grid access reduces project cost.
Environmental constraints guide layout and monitoring plans.
Reliable field measurements are essential before design decisions are made.

[Slide 12 - Civil and Environmental Design]
Foundations must resist drag, turbulence, and debris.
Scour protection is critical for long-term stability.
Fish passage and habitat continuity are core permitting requirements.
Visual impact and navigation safety also matter to communities.
Civil and environmental design is a multidisciplinary task.

[Slide 13 - Construction and Grid Integration]
Construction is often staged with modular components.
Work windows depend on flow conditions and navigation schedules.
Cables connect devices to shore substations, and transformers prepare power for the grid.
Early coordination with utilities helps avoid delays.
Access planning often drives the schedule and the cost.

[Slide 14 - Reliability Challenges]
Biofouling and corrosion are constant threats in water.
Cavitation can damage blades over time.
Solutions include coatings, materials selection, and planned inspections.
Reliability lowers lifecycle costs and improves bankability.
This is a key message for long-term deployment.

[Slide 15 - Conclusion and Global Outlook]
Hydrokinetic systems offer a low-impact way to harvest flowing water energy.
They fit locations where large dams are not feasible.
Success depends on site-specific engineering and clear regulation.
Think of a turbine as a fan in the flow, harvesting energy without stopping the river.
Thank you for listening.
