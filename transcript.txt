[Slide 1 - Cover]
Hello everyone. I'm Muhammet Yagcioglu, and my co-presenter is Hamidreza Khalaj Zahraei.
We are with the Izmir Institute of Technology, Department of Civil Engineering.
Our emails are on the slide if you want to follow up.
Today we introduce hydrokinetic power systems from a civil and water resources perspective.

[Slide 2 - Presentation Overview]
I will start with the big picture and why this technology matters.
Then I will define hydrokinetic energy and show how it differs from traditional hydropower.
I will also highlight key applications and global projects.
After that, Hamid will take over and cover engineering, siting, and delivery.

[Slide 3 - Introduction to Hydrokinetic Energy]
Hydrokinetic energy uses the motion of water itself.
Instead of storing water behind a dam, turbines sit in rivers or tidal channels.
This keeps the infrastructure smaller and faster to build.
It is often called zero-head or in-stream power.
The main idea is to harvest energy while keeping the river more natural.

[Slide 4 - Why Humanity Needs HECS]
Electricity demand keeps rising as populations grow and more sectors electrify.
The chart shows steady global growth over time.
At the same time, we must decarbonize the grid.
Hydrokinetic systems provide low-carbon power close to communities.
This combination of local supply and low impact makes the topic urgent.

[Slide 5 - Water-Energy-Climate Nexus]
Climate change is making water more variable and less predictable.
Droughts reduce flows and extreme events damage infrastructure.
Engineers must balance energy production with ecosystem health and community needs.
Hydrokinetic systems help because they avoid large reservoirs or major diversions.
They can be scaled and adapted over time, supporting water security.

[Slide 6 - Kinetic vs Potential Energy]
Conventional hydropower uses potential energy created by head.
That usually requires dams, reservoirs, and sometimes resettlement.
Hydrokinetic systems use kinetic energy in free-flowing water.
This reduces land take and preserves river connectivity.
In many regions, that difference is key for public acceptance.

[Slide 7 - Applications and Benefits]
These systems fit rivers, tidal straits, and coastal channels with steady flow.
Projects can be modular, so utilities can start small and expand.
Visual impact is low and civil works are lighter.
Tides are predictable, which helps grid planning.
That makes hydrokinetic power a strong complement to other renewables.
