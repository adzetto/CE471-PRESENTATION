    <!-- Slide 2: Introduction -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-2">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hydrokinetic energy conversion is a method of generating electricity from the movement of water without the need for large dams or reservoirs.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional hydropower, which relies on the potential energy of falling water, hydrokinetic systems utilize the kinetic energy of flowing water in rivers, estuaries, and ocean currents.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 3: Why Do We Need It? -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-3">
        <h2>Why Do We Need Hydrokinetic Energy?</h2>
        <p>The global demand for energy is rising exponentially.</p>
        <p>Fossil fuels are finite and contribute significantly to global warming and climate change.</p>
        <p>We need sustainable, renewable energy sources that can provide consistent power generation to support modern civilization.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 4: Limitations of Solar and Wind -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-4">
        <h2>The Limitations of Solar and Wind</h2>
        <p>While solar and wind energy are popular, they are intermittent.</p>
        <p>The sun does not shine at night, and the wind does not always blow.</p>
        <p>This intermittency requires expensive battery storage solutions or backup power plants to ensure grid stability.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 5: Advantage of Water Currents -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-5">
        <h2>The Advantage of Water Currents</h2>
        <p>Water currents are remarkably predictable and consistent.</p>
        <p>Tides can be predicted years in advance, and river flows are generally stable or change slowly.</p>
        <p>This predictability makes hydrokinetic energy an excellent candidate for baseload power generation, reducing the need for energy storage.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 6: History - Ancient Times -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-6">
        <h2>History of Water Energy: Ancient Times</h2>
        <p>The use of water energy dates back thousands of years.</p>
        <p>Ancient civilizations, including the Greeks and Romans, used water wheels to grind grain and pump water.</p>
        <p>These early systems were the ancestors of modern hydrokinetic turbines, utilizing the flow of rivers directly.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 7: History - Industrial Revolution -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-7">
        <h2>History: The Industrial Revolution</h2>
        <p>During the Industrial Revolution, water power was the primary source of energy for factories and textile mills.</p>
        <p>Water wheels evolved into more efficient turbines.</p>
        <p>However, as electricity demand grew, the focus shifted to massive hydroelectric dams that could store vast amounts of water.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 8: Problem with Large Dams -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-8">
        <h2>The Problem with Large Dams</h2>
        <p>While effective, large dams have significant environmental downsides.</p>
        <p>They disrupt local ecosystems, block fish migration, and alter sediment transport in rivers.</p>
        <p>Constructing dams also requires displacing communities and flooding large areas of land.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 9: Return to Hydrokinetic Concepts -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-9">
        <h2>Return to Hydrokinetic Concepts</h2>
        <p>In recent decades, there has been a renewed interest in "run-of-river" and zero-head systems.</p>
        <p>Engineers realized that we could generate power without building dams by placing turbines directly into the flow.</p>
        <p>This approach minimizes environmental impact and civil infrastructure costs.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 10: How It Works -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-10">
        <h2>How It Works: The Concept</h2>
        <p>The operating principle is very similar to a wind turbine.</p>
        <p>Instead of air moving over blades to create lift and rotation, moving water flows over underwater blades.</p>
        <p>Since water is much denser than air, even slow-moving water contains a tremendous amount of energy.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 11: System Components -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-11">
        <h2>System Components</h2>
        <p>A typical system consists of three main parts:</p>
        <div class="box">
            <p><strong>The Rotor:</strong> Blades that capture the energy from the water.</p>
            <p><strong>The Generator:</strong> Converts the mechanical rotation into electricity.</p>
            <p><strong>The Mooring/Foundation:</strong> Holds the turbine in place against the strong current.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 12: Horizontal Axis Turbines -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-12">
        <h2>Types of Turbines: Horizontal Axis</h2>
        <p>Horizontal Axis Hydrokinetic Turbines (HAHT) look like underwater windmills.</p>
        <p>They are the most common design and are highly efficient.</p>
        <p>However, they require the mechanism to be oriented into the direction of the flow.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 13: Vertical Axis Turbines -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-13">
        <h2>Types of Turbines: Vertical Axis</h2>
        <p>Vertical Axis Hydrokinetic Turbines (VAHT) look like eggbeaters.</p>
        <p>Their main advantage is that they can capture flow from any direction without needing to reorient.</p>
        <p>This makes them ideal for areas where tide directions change frequently.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 14: Civil Engineering - Foundations -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-14">
        <h2>Civil Engineering Aspects: Foundations</h2>
        <p>Securing these turbines is a major civil engineering challenge.</p>
        <p>Gravity-based foundations use heavy concrete blocks to hold the turbine down by weight.</p>
        <p>Pile foundations are driven deep into the riverbed or seabed, similar to offshore oil platforms.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 15: Civil Engineering - Materials -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-15">
        <h2>Civil Engineering Aspects: Materials</h2>
        <p>The underwater environment is harsh.</p>
        <p>Materials must withstand constant moisture, high pressure, and the corrosive effects of saltwater (in marine applications).</p>
        <p>Special marine-grade concrete and composites are essential for longevity.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 16: Environmental Impact -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-16">
        <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
        <p>Hydrokinetic systems are considered environmentally friendly.</p>
        <p>The blades rotate slowly, allowing fish to swim around them safely.</p>
        <p>There is no thermal pollution, and no emissions are released into the water or air.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 17: Potential in Turkey -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-17">
        <h2>Potential in Turkey</h2>
        <p>Turkey has significant potential for hydrokinetic energy.</p>
        <p>The Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits have strong, continuous currents that are ideal for energy harvesting.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the extensive irrigation canal networks in the GAP region offer controlled environments for smaller turbines.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 18: Economic Viability -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-18">
        <h2>Economic Viability</h2>
        <p>Currently, the cost of energy is higher than established technologies like wind or solar.</p>
        <p>However, as the technology matures and mass production begins, costs are expected to drop significantly.</p>
        <p>The low maintenance and long lifespan of civil structures contribute to good long-term economics.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 19: Future Outlook -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-19">
        <h2>Future Outlook</h2>
        <p>The future of hydrokinetic energy is promising.</p>
        <p>Research is focusing on array configurations, where multiple turbines work together like a wind farm.</p>
        <p>Innovations in materials science and smart grid integration will further enhance their adoption.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Slide 20: Conclusion -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-20">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Hydrokinetic energy conversion is a vital piece of the sustainable energy puzzle.</p>
        <p>It offers a reliable, baseload power source that complements intermittent renewables.</p>
        <p>For civil engineers, it presents exciting challenges in structural design, fluid dynamics, and marine construction.</p>
